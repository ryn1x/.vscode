# Change Log

## v0.1.22

- Reloads are now done with `:reload` when possible to greatly improve speed.
- `-fno-code` is no longer used for loading since it doesn't seem to do any good.
- Fix rare case where warning without corresponding flag breaks diagnostics.

## v0.1.21

- Warnings are no longer duplicated. Workaround for [GHC issue [#18068](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/18068)](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/18068).
- Extension will now only automatically restart GHCi sessions based on settings change if the change is related to this extension.
- Extension will no longer report failure when GHCi sessions are being restarted.
- Status bar activity indicator is more reliable.
- Other minor fixes and improvements.

## v0.1.20

- ([#12](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/12), [#59](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/pull/59), [#60](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/pull/60)) `:doc` output is available in completion and hover. Thanks to [EduardSergeev](https://github.com/EduardSergeev) for the contribution.
- ([#27](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/27), [#36](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/36)) Now when loading modules `-fno-code` is always used, and just before a REPL run either `-fbyte-code` (default) or `-fobject-code` is used to load the modules (configurable per workspace and per REPL block. See README).
- ([#58](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/pull/58)) You can customize the `GHC` prefix in the status bar indicator.
- Workaround for stack unable to start on Windows.
- Other minor fixes and improvements.

## v0.1.19

- Better icon. Geometrically derived from the logo on <https://haskell.org> using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), instead of the old mixture of eye-measured lines and manually painted background.
- [#54](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/54) Stack setup no longer uses `--stdout` with `stack ide targets`, making it compatible with older stack versions.
- [#55](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/55) Status bar indicator for GHC, telling you whether it is busy and what it's doing. Click to show logs.
- Evaluation in GHCi no longer gets deferred type errors.

## v0.1.18, v0.1.17

- Nothing on the user side.
- Internal: CI is now based on GitHub Actions. VSCode Marketplace does not allow retracting versions so when errors were made, versions were wasted. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## v0.1.16

- [#41](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/41) Further possible fix for 'rogue' GHCi processes consuming large amount of CPU and memory resources.
- Internal: Fix warnings about unhandled rejected promises.

## v0.1.15

- [#41](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/41) Possible fix for 'rogue' GHCi processes consuming large amount of CPU and memory resources.

## v0.1.13

## v0.1.2

- Fix parsing of single-line warnings

## v0.1.1

- ([#7](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/issues/7)) Some flags like `-Werror=no-home-modules` or `-fhide-source-paths` break vscode-ghc-simple. This has been worked around.

    - Type query now uses `:all-types` to find the range only, and uses `:type-at` to find the actual type. This replaces the unneededly complex 'type resolver'.
    - ([#14](https://github.com/dramforever/vscode-ghc-simple/pull/14)) Quote file names more carefully to handle paths with spaces.
